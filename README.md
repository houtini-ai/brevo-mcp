### Testing

- **Basic tests**: `npm test` - Tests core functionality
- **Analytics tests**: `node test-analytics.js` - Verifies analytics functions
- **Development mode**: `npm run dev` - Runs with file watching

### Analytics Implementation Notes

The analytics functionality leverages several Brevo API endpoints:

- `GET /v3/emailCampaigns/{campaignId}` - Individual campaign detailed reports
- `GET /v3/emailCampaigns?statistics=globalStats,linksStats` - Bulk campaign data with statistics
- `GET /v3/contacts/{identifier}/campaignStats` - Contact-level engagement analytics
- Various statistics parameters for detailed breakdowns including geographic and device data

The server automatically calculates performance rates, provides intelligent insights, and handles data quality considerations such as Apple Mail Privacy Protection impact on open rate accuracy.

## üîí Security

### üõ°Ô∏è **Critical Security Practices**

- **API Keys**: 
  - ‚ùå **NEVER** commit API keys to version control or hardcode them in files
  - ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** use environment variables: `process.env.BREVO_API_KEY`
  - ‚úÖ Use `.env` files for local development (already in `.gitignore`)
  - ‚úÖ Rotate API keys regularly and revoke compromised keys immediately

- **Environment Configuration**:
  - ‚úÖ Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API key
  - ‚úÖ Keep `.env` files out of version control (check `.gitignore`)
  - ‚úÖ Use different API keys for development, staging, and production environments

- **IP Whitelisting**: Configure Brevo IP restrictions at [security settings](https://app.brevo.com/security/authorised_ips)
- **Error Handling**: The server provides helpful error messages without exposing sensitive data
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements appropriate API rate limiting for bulk analytics requests

### üö® **Security Checklist**

Before deploying or sharing:
- [ ] No API keys in source code
- [ ] All backup files removed from repository
- [ ] `.env` file not committed to version control
- [ ] API keys rotated if previously exposed
- [ ] IP whitelisting configured (if required by your setup)
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured in production
