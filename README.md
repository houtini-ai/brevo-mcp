   - Add test email addresses to the list
   - This is a one-time setup

2. **Create Campaign**
   ```
   Use: create_email_campaign
   - Set name, subject
   - Add HTML content or template
   - Configure recipient lists
   - Sender auto-detected (or specify custom)
   ```

3. **Test Campaign**
   ```
   Use: send_test_email
   - Provide only campaignId
   - Automatically sends to your test list
   - Review the test email
   ```

4. **Update if Needed**
   ```
   Use: update_email_campaign
   - Modify content, subject, etc.
   - Re-test as needed
   ```

5. **Send Campaign**
   ```
   Use: send_campaign_now
   - Sends to all configured recipients
   - Or schedule with scheduledAt parameter
   ```

### Important Notes

- **Test List**: The MCP assumes you have a pre-configured test list in Brevo
- **send_test_email**: By default sends to your test list (omit emailTo parameter)
- **Safety**: Always test before sending to actual recipients
- **No Duplicate**: The duplicate campaign feature is not available in Brevo API

## Installation

### Quick Start

1. **Install via npm:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @houtini/brevo-mcp
   ```

2. **Configure Claude Desktop:**

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "brevo": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@houtini/brevo-mcp"],
         "env": {
           "BREVO_API_KEY": "your-brevo-api-key-here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop**

### Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/houtini-ai/brevo-mcp.git
   cd brevo-mcp
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. Add to Claude Desktop config:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "brevo": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["C:/path/to/brevo-mcp/dist/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "BREVO_API_KEY": "your-brevo-api-key-here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `BREVO_API_KEY` - Your standard Brevo v3 API key (required)
  - Must be the standard API key that starts with `xkeysib-`
  - Found in Brevo Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ API Keys
  - Note: MCP-specific API keys will be supported in a future release
- `BREVO_BASE_URL` - Custom API base URL (optional, defaults to https://api.brevo.com/v3)

### Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to your [Brevo account](https://app.brevo.com)
2. Go to Settings â†’ API Keys
3. **Use the Standard API Key** (not the MCP API key)
   - The standard v3 API key starts with `xkeysib-`
   - MCP API key support coming in a future release
4. Create a new API key or copy an existing one
5. **Important**: You may need to whitelist your IP address in Brevo's security settings

## ðŸ“® Sender Configuration

### Intelligent Sender Management

The MCP automatically detects and uses your verified sender, making campaign creation simpler and safer:

#### **Default Behaviour**
- **Auto-detection**: If no sender is specified, the MCP automatically uses your verified sender from existing campaigns
- **Smart fallback**: Checks sent campaigns first, then draft campaigns if needed
- **Safety first**: All test emails use the verified sender to prevent delivery issues

#### **How It Works**
```javascript
// Option 1: Auto-detect sender (RECOMMENDED)
create_email_campaign({
  name: "My Campaign",
  subject: "Hello World",
  htmlContent: "<h1>Content</h1>"
  // No sender needed - uses verified sender automatically
})

// Option 2: Specify sender by ID (for specific IP pools)
create_email_campaign({
  name: "My Campaign",
  subject: "Hello World",
  htmlContent: "<h1>Content</h1>",
  sender: {
    name: "Custom Name",
    id: 2  // Your sender ID from Brevo
  }
})

// Option 3: Specify sender by email (must be verified)
create_email_campaign({
  name: "My Campaign",
  subject: "Hello World",
  htmlContent: "<h1>Content</h1>",
  sender: {
    name: "Custom Name",
    email: "verified@yourdomain.com"
  }
})
```

#### **Finding Your Sender ID**
To find your sender ID, check any existing campaign:
```javascript
get_email_campaigns({ limit: 1 })
// Response includes: sender: { id: 2, email: "...", name: "..." }
```

#### **Important Notes**
- **Verified senders only**: Email addresses must be verified in Brevo before use
- **Test emails**: Always sent from the verified sender for reliability
- **IP Pools**: Use sender ID (not email) if you have dedicated IP pools
- **First-time setup**: Create at least one campaign in Brevo dashboard to establish a verified sender

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start Guide

Once configured, try these commands to get started:

1. **Check your setup**: "Show my Brevo account info"
2. **View campaigns**: "List my email campaigns"
3. **Create a campaign**: "Create a new email campaign called 'Newsletter'"
4. **Send a test**: "Send a test email for campaign ID 123"
5. **Check performance**: "Show analytics for my campaigns this week"
6. **Manage campaigns**: "Pause campaign ID 456"

The MCP server understands natural language, so you can phrase requests conversationally!
